project_description='Jisql is a Java based utility to provide a command line interactive session with a SQL server. This application is conceptually modeled on the Sybase 'isql' program with, obviously, strong similarities to Microsoft SQL/Server isql and osql (as Microsoft got SQL Server from Sybase).
